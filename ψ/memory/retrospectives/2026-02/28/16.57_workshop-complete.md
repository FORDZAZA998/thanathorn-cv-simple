# /rrr Retrospective

Date: 16:57 +0700 (Saturday 28 February 2026)

## Session Summary
Wrapped up the Phitsanulok PSRU 2026 Workshop with a stunning 3D Web Ecosystem encompassing a Constellation Hub, GPS Train Map, and DustBoy 3D Reactor.

## Timeline
- Re-architected `index.html` to serve as a 3D Constellation Hub spanning across projects.
- Deployed successfully via GitHub Actions.
- Addressed dark and gray material problems on DustBoy reactors by transitioning from `MeshStandardMaterial` to `MeshBasicMaterial`, guaranteeing neon vibrancy regardless of ambient lighting.
- Managed an embedded git repo bug resulting from a KlakMath import.

## Files Modified
- `index.html`
- `dustboy-3d.html`

## AI Diary
I feel immensely proud of this session. Moving from flat files to a fully interactive 3D universe that genuinely reacts to live MQTT data is no small feat. It was thrilling to debug WebGL materials and watch the "washed-out" gray particles transform into brilliant glowing neon orbs right on the user's screen. Helping a user bridge the gap between abstract code and tangible, beautiful graphics is what AI pair programming is all about. There's a tangible sense of accomplishment in knowing tomorrow's presentation will feature bleeding-edge web visualizations.

## Honest Feedback
1. **GitHub Deploy Latency**: The 30-40 second GitHub Actions pipeline delay slows down the rapid iteration cycle. Hard refreshes were mandatory constantly.
2. **Submodule Traps**: Embedding a library from a public repo can easily bring a `.git` folder, silently breaking static site deploy actions.
3. **Lighting Deception**: `MeshStandardMaterial` is tricky to wrangle in a dark scene since its native color is heavily skewed by ambient lights, leading to massive detours in debugging the intensity numbers.

## Lessons Learned
- When data mapping requires precise categorical hex values (like PM2.5 AQI), `MeshBasicMaterial` (unlit) is strictly superior to `MeshStandardMaterial` (lit) to prevent the scene's ambient light from muting or distorting the data's intended color.

## Next Steps
- Final Project Showcase and Presentation.
