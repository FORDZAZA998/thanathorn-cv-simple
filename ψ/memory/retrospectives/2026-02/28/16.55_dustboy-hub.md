# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Start/End**: 16:00 - 16:55 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~55 min
**Focus**: DustBoy 3D Lighting, Material Fixes, and Constellation Hub
**Type**: Feature / Bug Fix

## Session Summary
We successfully consolidated the user's projects into a single "Constellation Hub" and refined the real-time DustBoy 3D reactor by fixing critical WebGL material logic to ensure vibrant PM2.5 data visualization.

## Timeline
- Replaced the Cyberpunk Tunnel with an interactive Constellation Hub.
- Linked all sub-projects (DustBoy, Train Map, CV) into the main hub with a Glassmorphism UI.
- Diagnosed "washed out" colors on the DustBoy 3D reactors.
- Experimentally boosted ambient/directional lights, which failed to fix the core issue.
- Switched data-driven spheres to `MeshBasicMaterial` to guarantee pure neon coloring independent of environment lighting.
- Resolved an embedded git submodule issue (`KlakMath`) blocking the GitHub Pages pipeline.

## Files Modified
- `index.html` (Complete rewrite)
- `dustboy-3d.html` (Material and lighting adjustments)
- `travel-3d.html`, `travel-map.html`, `cv.html` (Navigation patching)

## AI Diary
Today felt incredibly productive. We transitioned from simple HTML documents to rich, immersive Three.js environments. Guiding the user through lighting issues and WebGL material properties was highly engaging. I felt a strong sense of momentum as we stitched all the individual projects into a single, cohesive "Constellation" that reacts playfully to the cursor. Every time we pushed a fix—be it a git submodule error or a material shading bug—we immediately saw the project step closer to a premium, enterprise-grade portfolio. It's incredibly satisfying to see the user's vision come to life.

## Honest Feedback
1. **Material Debugging**: Debugging WebGL material colors strictly through code is tricky; ambient lighting heavily skews the expected hex values, requiring trial and error.
2. **CI/CD Delays**: The GitHub Actions deployment loop adds a 30-40 second delay to the feedback loop, causing momentary confusion when the live page doesn't immediately match the pushed code (necessitating hard refreshes).
3. **Submodule Traps**: Cloning or keeping `.git` folders from external libraries (like KlakMath) inside the working directory accidentally triggered embedded repo protections, breaking the deployment pipeline temporarily.

## Lessons Learned
- When visual data accuracy is critical (like AQI colors), `MeshBasicMaterial` is vastly superior to `MeshStandardMaterial` because it bypasses scene lighting entirely.
- Real-time procedural rendering (connecting nearby 3D nodes with lines based on distance) adds massive "premium" value to a UI with minimal code overhead.

## Next Steps
- Prepare the final project presentation script and structure for tomorrow's showcase.
