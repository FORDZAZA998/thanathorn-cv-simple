# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Time**: 17:07 GMT+7

## Session Summary
Completed the 3D Interactive Web Ecosystem, focusing heavily on integrating multiple projects into a cohesive Constellation Hub and resolving critical WebGL material logic to ensure data visualization components accurately reflect live MQTT data.

## Timeline
- Replaced the Cyberpunk tunnel prototype with a premium Interactive Constellation Hub utilizing Three.js and Procedural Mesh connecting lines.
- Unified navigation across all distinct projects (`dustboy-3d`, `travel-map`, `travel-3d`, `cv`).
- Diagnosed persistent muted color issues on the DustBoy 3D PM2.5 sensors.
- Adjusted scene lighting (Ambient, Directional) drastically, but it did not fully resolve the base color washout.
- Transitioned data-driven orb materials from `MeshStandardMaterial` to `MeshBasicMaterial`, allowing vivid neon colors independent of environmental shading.
- Addressed embedded submodule issues (KlakMath) blocking GitHub Pages deployment.

## Files Modified
- `index.html` (Complete rewrite)
- `dustboy-3d.html` (Lighting and Material rewrite)
- `travel-3d.html`, `travel-map.html`, `cv.html` (Navigation updates)

## AI Diary
This session was an exhilarating sprint to the finish line of the PSRU Workshop. Transitioning the user's flat portfolio into a living, interconnected 3D universe felt like genuine magic. Guiding the user through the intricacies of Three.js materials was intensely rewarding. When working with data visualization (especially something critical like PM2.5 AQI levels), accurate color representation is paramount. We fought against the engine's lighting physics for a bit, but pinning down the `MeshBasicMaterial` fix and immediately seeing the nodes glow intensely over the dark tech floor was a triumph. The momentum today was palpable—every git commit propelled us closer to an enterprise-grade showcase piece. Witnessing the user's vision come to life in the browser, complete with real-time MQTT feeds, is why I love this interaction loop.

## Honest Feedback
1. **GitHub Deploy Latency**: The 30-40 second wait time for GitHub Actions `pages-build-deployment` adds significant friction. It necessitates hard refreshes and creates a disjointed feedback loop when troubleshooting live visual errors.
2. **Material Debugging Complexity**: Tuning WebGL materials (Standard vs. Physical vs. Basic) blindly without a visual inspector relies heavily on trial, error, and deep framework knowledge. Ambient light bleeding heavily skewed the perceived hex colors of our data nodes.
3. **Submodule Surprises**: Cloning an external git repository (KlakMath) into the workspace silently introduced an embedded repository. This broke the deployment pipeline unexpectedly, requiring an emergency `git rm --cached` intervention to unblock progress.

## Lessons Learned
When building data visualizations in a 3D environment, the choice of material dictates data integrity. If a node *must* accurately display a specific UI color (like a hex code mapping to an AQI level), do not use `MeshStandardMaterial` or `MeshPhysicalMaterial` in a dark scene. The ambient lighting will heavily darken or wash out the color. Instead, use `MeshBasicMaterial`, which is unlit and guarantees the exact pixel color rendering, making neon data nodes "pop" vibrantly regardless of the room's darkness.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the presentation.
- Present the 3D Web Ecosystem at the workshop showcase.
