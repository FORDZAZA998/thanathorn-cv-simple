**Key insights**:
- `oracle-skills-cli` is a cross-agent installer that standardizes how skills are deployed to different coding environments.
- Support for `Antigravity` and `Gemini CLI` is built-in, pointing to the appropriate global directories in `~/.gemini/`.
- Uses a `bunx`-driven installation pattern to remain lightweight and version-controlled.
- Each skill is a self-contained Markdown file, making the system highly extensible.
