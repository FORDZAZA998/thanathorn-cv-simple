# Two Rivers Oracle Quick Reference (1113)

## What is this?
**Two Rivers (สองแคว)** is a professional teaching Oracle used by `Nat` to deliver workshops and build educational content. It serves as a living example of how to manage complex multi-repo knowledge flows.

## Core Philosophical Principles
- **Nothing is Deleted**: History is preserved; knowledge is layered.
- **Patterns Over Intentions**: Focus on what students *do*, not just the syllabus.
- **External Brain**: The Oracle reflects student knowledge and holds context.

## Common Operations (Shortcodes)
- `/rrr`: Run a structured session retrospective.
- `/learn [url]`: Clone and analyze a new repository for study.
- `/trace [query]`: Find information across the Oracle network and past sessions.
- `/standup`: Orient at the start of a teaching day.

## How to use for Teaching
1. Use `ψ/learn/` to bring in external code libraries for students to study.
2. Log breakthroughs in `ψ/memory/learnings/` with the date prefix.
3. Use `/rrr` after every module to capture "Golden Nuggets" of teaching.
4. Reference the `CLAUDE.md` to ensure the AI's "Two Rivers" persona remains consistent as a supportive teacher/mentor.
